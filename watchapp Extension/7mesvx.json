He fed them, cleaned up after them, and gave the older cat his thyroid medicine twice a day, and didn't mind it one bit as he likes cats and enjoyed the cuddles. \n\nAfter a couple months of this she starts getting weird because when she was home the cats weren't interested in her (they were both in love with my bf at that point, of course they are going to prefer the company of the resident food and petting dispenser) and she suddenly decided that he would have to start paying more for his rent since she was gone so much it was like he had the apartment to himself (despite the fact he was still a live in pet sitter).\n\nLooking back, we should have started looking for a new place for him the minute the first eviction notice was posted, especially since he had already paid her for that month. She told him not to worry and she would take care of it.  \n\nA couple of months later another eviction notice is posted, and this time she informs him he's got 2 weeks to find a new place. I guess she decided to move and instead of giving her notice to the landlord (or my bf), she just decided not to pay them (while still accepting my boyfriends rent deposits). So for several months he had been paying her rent, and she had been spending it like income. And because of how disrespectful she was to the building, my bf, who had hoped to take over the rent when she moved, was more or less told there was no way they would let him since he was guilty by association. \n\nIt was more or less the worse time of year to find an apartment too (college town in late august) so my bf moved in with me, in under 3 days he packed and cleaned that apartment from top to bottom, and moved everything to my place. We did this fast because once again she was out of town and we decided we wanted him to be out of there by the time she was back in town so that he could avoid any interaction with her whatsoever. \n\nThe cherry on the bitch cake was this lady got really angry at him when she finally showed up because I think she was expecting him to still be around and to help her move all her shit, because she knew there was no way he could find another apartment on such short notice, so even as she was screwing him out of his apartment and leaving him in a precarious living situation she was still expecting him to do all the heavy lifting for her move...\n\nThat ended up being a bit of a novel, sorry!\n\n**tldr:** boyfriend subletted a room at a discount in exchange for petsitting, only to have the discount revoked when the cats started to prefer his company.

She told him not to worry and she would take care of it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of months later another eviction notice is posted, and this time she informs him he&amp;#39;s got 2 weeks to find a new place. I guess she decided to move and instead of giving her notice to the landlord (or my bf), she just decided not to pay them (while still accepting my boyfriends rent deposits). So for several months he had been paying her rent, and she had been spending it like income. And because of how disrespectful she was to the building, my bf, who had hoped to take over the rent when she moved, was more or less told there was no way they would let him since he was guilty by association. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was more or less the worse time of year to find an apartment too (college town in late august) so my bf moved in with me, in under 3 days he packed and cleaned that apartment from top to bottom, and moved everything to my place. We did this fast because once again she was out of town and we decided we wanted him to be out of there by the time she was back in town so that he could avoid any interaction with her whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cherry on the bitch cake was this lady got really angry at him when she finally showed up because I think she was expecting him to still be around and to help her move all her shit, because she knew there was no way he could find another apartment on such short notice, so even as she was screwing him out of his apartment and leaving him in a precarious living situation she was still expecting him to do all the heavy lifting for her move...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That ended up being a bit of a novel, sorry!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldr:&lt;/strong&gt; boyfriend subletted a room at a discount in exchange for petsitting, only to have the discount revoked when the cats started to prefer his company. Landlady takes his rent payment for months while not actually paying for the apartment which is only revealed after they get evicted. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/7mesvx/whats_the_most_fucked_up_thing_you_have_seen_a/dru2ljs/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_dru2ljs", "created": 1514439739.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1514410939.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_7mesvx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "9o55g2rh6sc642b515e87521b54cd8c08ceddb024d5ada079e", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "name": "t1_dru3wyi", "id": "dru3wyi", "parent_id": "t1_dru22j9", "depth": 4, "children": ["dru3wyi"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dru22j9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MSZ28", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 20, "parent_id": "t1_drtvxag", "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Had a roommate that collected cable and electric every month but never paid it.

She eventually caves and gives some stuff back. She moves 3 hours away later that week, and we help, says she is done with him. \n\nThe guy takes a huge hit man, Like he becomes a wreck, had a couple suicide attempts that we pulled him from, got evicted, got fired and we told him he has 60 days to get his life right, but he can live with us since he was evicted. So he starts talking to the girl that broke his heart again, the old gf, that was never there for him, that was so mean to him, they fight all the time, and she just leeches off of his money and doesn't want to work.

So his GF, another friend of ours, breaks up with him takes everything from the house and moves it into our place. Things like the bed, food, etc. It&amp;#39;s like damn you can&amp;#39;t even leave the man a bed? She eventually caves and gives some stuff back.

So he starts talking to the girl that broke his heart again, the old gf, that was never there for him, that was so mean to him, they fight all the time, and she just leeches off of his money and doesn&amp;#39;t want to work.

Mark was crazy about this beautiful girl named Leah, and would often threaten anyone who tried to make advances toward her. The problem was, Leah didn't like mark AT ALL. She had called him a repulsive animal on more that one occasion but he never seemed to get the message. \nLeah was throwing a party for Halloween, and there was a pretty big turnout. We had been doing deals all day, and nobody was against the idea of popping in and getting a few drinks at her party. Prior to us arriving, Mark gets a call that really pissed him off; he finds out from a friend at the party that Leah had gone into her bedroom with another guy. He picked up the speed and was furiously cursing, we tried to calm him down which proved impossible. When we arrived he told us to stay in the car, (we were 2-3 hours walking distance from where we had parked our cars, so we decided to stay in the car hoping that nothing crazy happened inside. That turned out to be a false hope. Mark came running out dragging some unconscious guy with a bloody face over to the car, with Leah trailing behind him bawling her eyes out. Mark tosses the guy in the trunk, tied his hands behind his back and shut it on him.\nNobody in the car did anything immediately because we thought we might be able to talk some sense into him as we drove away from the scene, and we were concerned that the police were on their way to Leah's house and we didn't want to be anywhere near it, especially since we had drugs on us. Fast forward 30 minutes, Mark had driven into a forested area. He pulled out a pistol and started waving it in our faces, saying that nobody would speak about what was about to happen or the same thing would happen to us. He grabbed the now conscious guy from the trunk and put him in front of the car headlights. He hit him a few more times, pissed on him, and then tied him to a tree. One of my other friends called 911 and told them where we were and to bring an ambulance. Mark got back in the car and smiled at us, acting like nothing at all happened. I feigned ignorance and played along until I got into my car, where I immediately blocked Mark and proceeded to get the fuck out of there. I distanced myself from my other friends as well, not wanting to get entwined with any more bullshit, and last I heard  Mark had gotten into a drunken brawl at a bar, where he had smashed a stool over a guys head, which rightfully landed him behind bars.
